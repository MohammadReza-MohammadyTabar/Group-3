      <h2>Ghormeh Sabzi (Persian Herb Stew)</h2>
      <p>Ghorme Sabzi or Persian herb stew is undoubtedly the nation’s most-loved dish and there’s no need to discuss the popularity of Ghormeh Sabzi among the Iranian. Hardly ever will you find a person who doesn’t like this stew.

        It is in fact irresistible to say no to this savory flavored mixture of herbs coming along with tender cooked meat and very unique Persian dried limes.
       
       Just to clarify how popular this stew is, I want to let you know that, ironically, the Iranian believe that you have no cooking abilities unless you can cook Ghormeh Sabzi.</p>

        <h4>Ghorme Sabzi and Its History!</h4>
        <p>Ghorme sabzi is an Iranian dish, which is about 2000 to 5000 years old! So this is a national food. However, the ingredients used in preparing this dish have always been slightly different all over Iran, the main flavor always remained the same.
          The very important point about this food is that it has been always on Persian’s table. An inseparable member of the Persian cuisine. Better to that the name of the dish is made of two parts “Ghorme” and “Sabzi”. Ghorme refers to a special way of keeping meat healthy and sabzi refers to vegetables. As you see, the name completely suits the appearance of the dish ghorme sabzi.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong> <br>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.

      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <p>Substitute lamb stew meat for the chuck roast if preferred. <br>
        In Persian we have a term as “Ja Oftadan” which is basically a stage after being cooked. In this text I have used the term “prepare” for it. Let me put it like this, when the food is cooked, the taste of rawness is gone. But when it’s “well-prepared”, it tastes heavenly because you can taste a nice blend of different tastes. For Ghormeh Sabzi to be well-prepared, you need to chop the vegetables into really small pieces, or it won’t be well-prepared and it won’t taste as heavenly as it should! <br>

        It’s better to use raw vegetables, but if necessary, you can keep raw vegetables in a freezer. <br>
        
        The thing you need to pay attention to when frying the vegetables just like what you do with Khoresh Karafs is that you should add the oil before the vegetables have lost the water in them. If you do this, they will look better in color. Also, do not fry them for a long time because if you do so, they will look darker and lose their properties! <br>
        
        The less water there is in the stew, the more delicious and better prepared it will be. <br>
        
        To make the stew look more beautiful, after you have put out the flame of the gas burner, you can add a few cubes of ice to the stew. If you do this, the fat and oil will move to the surface of the stew which will make it look better.</p>
